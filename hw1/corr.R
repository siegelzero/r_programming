# Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for
# complete cases and calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for
# monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all
# variables) is greater than the threshold. The function should return a vector
# of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement. If no
# monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the function should return a
# numeric vector of length 0.
